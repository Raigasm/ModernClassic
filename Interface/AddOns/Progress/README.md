# Progress
A WoW Classic Addon that shows your progress towards level 60 total XP.
Simply displays a percentage based on remaining xp to go through all levels.
Note that this is not indicative of how much play time it will take to reach 60, as kills and quests have larger XP returns at higher levels.

## Installation
1. Copy the "Progress" folder into \Interface\AddOns\
2. Restart WoW
3. type /progress in game to see your progress
4. for every % of the total XP to level 60 you reach you get a message in game
